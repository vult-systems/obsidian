# Obsidian Repository
In my freetime, I role-play as a pipeline developer, technical director, programmer, network specialist, home labber, and so much more. My hope is to utilize this repo to collect my thoughts, perfect my technical writing, gather references, develop scripts, and more.

End game and best case scenerio would be to create practicle, production ready tools and identify best practices that can be applied to larger knowledge bases and production processes for my personal and professional work.

## Production Goals
The current objective driving my learning path is that I would like to not only standup an "academic friendly" offline and real-time production pipeline, but I'd like to make it reproducible, scalable, and accessible. 

This process has been in the works for the last couple years allowing me to have some control variables, some infrastructure, and some trial & error. However, I'm at a point in which automation, documentation, and learning are a neccessity. 

Bringing the industry to academia has always been a driving factor. I've pushed for my students to not only excel in their chosen discipline, but to do so with industry in mind. That said, framing their minds and works to accomplish that would be a ton easier if the University had a pipeline live and deployed. We're in the heat of battle now - Perforce up and running, Linux server and Nas ready and waiting, Deadline is finally deployed as a service, YouTrack is our knowledge base and project management hub, and the students are gaining real-world experience throughout their time with us. 

It's not perfect, but I can see the light. I'm an artist first, but this rabbit hole has been a ton of fun and I'm enjoying all the new. I'll continue to document as I go here as I rp the programmer life.

## Looking Ahead 
Once we iron out and document our current pipeline, the plan is to deploy a pipeline solution using Ayon or Prism. I can see this occuring in the next year or so (being hopeful), but first the objective is gain an understanding of how we make games and films. There's no right or wrong here and as long as the students gain some experience being plugged into a production pipeline, I believe this will all be worth it. 

- Python
    - Developer tools
    - Maya, Substance, Arnold, UE5, etc.
- C++
    - I'd personally like to dive into it to scratch my rp programming UE5 developer itch
- AYON Pipeline
- Prism Pipeline
- Houdini
    - Mainly for Solaris
- USD
    - This is the ultimate goal and honestly is what kick started all of this.
    - Mission complete once USD is in play for offline and real-time productions.
