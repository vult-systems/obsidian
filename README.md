# Obsidian Repository

In my free time, I role-play as a pipeline developer, technical director, programmer, network specialist, homelabber, and so much more. This repo is where I collect my thoughts, perfect my technical writing, gather references, and develop scripts.

**End goal:** Create practical, production-ready tools and identify best practices that scale across larger knowledge bases and production processes - both personal and professional.

## Stack

**Knowledge & Version Control**
- **Obsidian** - Knowledge base
- **Git (GitHub)** - Version and source control

**Development Tools**
- **PowerShell** - Command line & scripting
  - Oh My Posh & PSReadLine
  - Automation scripts
- **NeoVim** - Primary editor

## Production Goals

My current objective is to stand up an "academic-friendly" offline and real-time production pipeline that's reproducible, scalable, and accessible.

This process has been in the works for a couple years now - giving me control variables, infrastructure, and plenty of trial and error. But I'm at the point where automation, documentation, and systematic learning are no longer optional.

**The mission:** Bring industry-standard pipelines to academia.

I've pushed my students to excel in their discipline *with industry in mind*. Framing their work around real-world production workflows is infinitely easier when the university has an actual pipeline deployed. 

### Current State

**We're in the heat of battle:**
- Perforce deployed and running
- Linux server and NAS deployed
- Deadline running as a service
- YouTrack managing projects and documentation
- Students gaining real-world production experience

It's not perfect, but I can see the light. I'm an artist first, but this rabbit hole has been a ton of fun, and I'm enjoying the journey. I'll continue documenting as I RP the programmer life.

## Current Pipeline Tools

### 3D Software
- **Autodesk Maya** - Home software
- **Arnold** - Offline renderer
- Plus a ton of other DCCs for both game and film assets...

### Render Management
- **AWS Thinkbox Deadline** - Render farm orchestration

### Post-Production
- **DaVinci Resolve** - Compositing & color
- **Adobe Premiere** - Editing

### Real-Time Engines
- **Unreal Engine 5** - Primary game engine
- **Unity** - Secondary engine

### Project Management & Communication
- **YouTrack** - Project tracking & knowledge base
- **Microsoft Teams** - Team communication

### Infrastructure
- **Linux Server**
  - Perforce (version & source control)
  - Deadline repository
  - Render farm backend
- **NAS** - Centralized storage
- **Network Drives** - UNC paths for file access
- **Subst Drives** - Universal absolute paths (`S:\ProjectTAG`)
- **Lab Network** - ~85 machines with varying specs

## Looking Ahead

Once we document our current pipeline and iron out the workflows, the plan is to deploy **AYON** or **Prism Pipeline**. I can see this happening in the next year or so (being hopeful). 

First, though, we need to understand *how* we make games and films with what we have. There's no right or wrong here - as long as students gain experience working in a production pipeline, it's worth it.

### On the Roadmap

- **Python** - Pipeline tools for Maya, Substance, Arnold, UE5, etc.
- **C++** - Scratching my RP UE5 developer itch
- **AYON Pipeline** - Future deployment target
- **Prism Pipeline** - Alternative solution
- **Houdini** - Mainly for Solaris workflows
- **USD (Universal Scene Description)** - *The ultimate goal*
  - This is what kick-started everything
  - Mission complete once USD is integrated for offline and real-time productions

**Bottom line:** I'm an artist first, pipeline TD second - learning and documenting the journey as I go!
