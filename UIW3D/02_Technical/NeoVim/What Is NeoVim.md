### Description
NeoVim is a hyperextensible keyboard centric Vim-based text editor...or in human readable terminology, it's a highly customizable terminal with an emphasis on keyboard-centric usability. To utilize NeoVim to it's fullest extent, it's recommended you use the keyboard as the main mode of operation and existing in a world where mice do not exist. Anti-mouse is the play to become a NeoVim machine.

# Brief History
In 1976, Bill Joy created `VI` and in 1991, Bram Moolenaar improved `VI` and created `Vim`. Then in 2014, `NeoVim` came along. It's a fork of Vim and doesn't pretend otherwise. 

Because of this, plugins can be developed with Vim Script and Lua - a multi paradigm language notably used on platforms like Roblox. Lua was used to write it's built in Language Server Protocol (LSP Client) for code auto completion. It has a scriptable Terminal Emulator in addition to a bunch of other plugins. Telescope being critical - a fuzzy finder that can search for files across your system.
