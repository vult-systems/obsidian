### Description
Learn X in Y minutes is a website for short programming language tutorials developed to get programmers up to speed quickly on a new language created by Adam Bards. It started as a blog response to a Lua tutorial he saw and he was then encouraged to set up a website and accept contributions via Github. 

>Whirlwind tours of (several, hopefully many someday) popular and ought-to-be-more-popular programming languages, presented as valid, commented code and explained as they go.
