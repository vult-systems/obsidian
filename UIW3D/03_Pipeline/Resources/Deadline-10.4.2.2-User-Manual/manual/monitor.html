<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Monitor application offers detailed information and control options for each job and Worker in your farm.
It provides normal users a means of monitoring and controlling their jobs, and it gives administrators options for configuring and controlling the entire render farm.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_preview.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_preview.png" src="../_images/monitor_preview.png" style="height: 600px;" /></a>
<p>If you’re launching the Monitor for the first time on your machine, you will be prompted with a Login dialog. Simply choose your user name or create a new one before continuing.
Once the Monitor is running, you’ll see your user name in the bottom right corner. If this is the wrong user, you can log in as another user by selecting File -&gt; Change User.
Note that if your administrator set up Deadline to lock the user to the system’s login account, you will have to log off of your system and log back in as the correct user.</p>

<h2>Running the Monitor<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-monitor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To start the Monitor:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>On Windows, you can start the Monitor from the Start Menu under Thinkbox\Deadline, or from the Launcher’s right-click menu.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux, you can start the Monitor from a terminal window by running the deadlinemonitor script in the bin folder, or from the Launcher’s right-click menu.</p></li>
<li><p>On macOS, you can start the Monitor from Finder by running the DeadlineMonitor application in Applications/Thinkbox/Deadline, or from the Launcher’s right-click menu.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Monitor can also be started from a command prompt or terminal window. For more information, see the <a class="reference internal" href="#monitor-command-line-label"><span class="std std-ref">Monitor Command Line</span></a> documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panel-features">
<span id="monitor-panel-features-ref-label"></span><h2>Panel Features<a class="headerlink" href="#panel-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Information in the Monitor is broken up into different panels, which are described further down. These panels have many features in common, which are explained here.</p>
<div class="section" id="customization">
<h3>Customization<a class="headerlink" href="#customization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Monitor panels can be created from the View menu, or from the main toolbar. They can be re-sized, docked, or floated as desired.
This allows for a highly customized viewing experience which is adaptable to the needs of different users.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/spawn_panel.png"><img alt="../_images/spawn_panel.png" src="../_images/spawn_panel.png" style="height: 400px;" /></a>
<p>The current layout can be pinned to the Pinned Layouts menu so that it can be restored at a later time.
This can be done from the View menu, or from the main toolbar. The current layout can also be saved to a file from the View menu, and then loaded from that file later.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_layouts.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_layouts.png" src="../_images/monitor_layouts.png" style="height: 400px;" /></a>
<p>When you pin a layout you can chose to save the location and size of the Monitor by checking the “Save Location and Size” box when pinning the layout.</p>
<img alt="../_images/monitor_new_layout.png" src="../_images/monitor_new_layout.png" />
<p>To prevent accidental modifications to the current layout, you can lock the layout from the View menu, by pressing “Alt-`&quot;, or from the main toolbar. When locked, panels cannot be moved, but they can still be docked and undocked.
To dock a floating panel while the layout is locked, simply double-click on the panels title. It will be docked to the same location it was originally undocked from.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_lock.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_lock.png" src="../_images/monitor_lock.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>
<p>The columns in Monitor panels are customizable. The columns can be resized by simply clicking on the separator column line and moving it and can be reordered by clicking on a column and moving it. Right clicking on the column headers in a panel allows you to toggle
the visibility of each column.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_job_columns_click.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_job_columns_click.png" src="../_images/monitor_job_columns_click.png" style="height: 400px;" /></a>
<p>In this menu you can modify the visibility and ordering of the columns by clicking the “Customize..” menu item. Moving columns to the left side list hides them, and the order that columns are listed in the right list corresponds to
the order they will appear in the panel (top-&gt;bottom corresponds to left-&gt;right). You move the columns around by clicking the arrow buttons.</p>
<img alt="../_images/monitor_customize_columns.png" src="../_images/monitor_customize_columns.png" />
<p>Once you have configured your column layout you can pin it.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/monitor_pin_list_layout.png"><img alt="pinlayout" src="../_images/monitor_pin_list_layout.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a> <img alt="layoutname" src="../_images/monitor_pin_list_name.png" /></p>
<p>You can also set the current list layout as the list layout to load by default, when opening new panels of the same type, by clicking “Save Current List Layout As Default”. If you want to restore the original list layout default
click the “Reset Default List Layout”.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In Deadline version 10.4 and higher, the layout file format changed. If upgrading from Deadline versions prior to 10.4, the local layout file (saved in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%APPDATA%\Thinkbox\</span></code> on Windows and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.config/Thinkbox/</span></code> on Linux and macOS) will automatically be converted to the new format. Old versions of Deadline will not work with the new layout file format, however a backup of the layout file will be created in the same directory with “Legacy Backup” appended to the name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-filtering">
<h3>Data Filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#data-filtering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Almost every panel has a search box that you can use to filter the information you’re interested in. You can simply type in the word(s) you are looking for, or use regular expressions for more advanced searching.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/job_search.png"><img alt="../_images/job_search.png" src="../_images/job_search.png" style="height: 200px;" /></a>
<p>In addition, every panel that has a search box also supports a more advanced filtering system. To add a filter to a panel, select the Edit Filter
option in the panel’s drop down menu, which can be found in the upper-right corner of the panel. A window will appear allowing you to specify the name the
filter being created. You can select to match all of the filters added or any of the filters added. If all must match, only records where all data matches each filter will
be shown, while if any can match, if a record contains one or more matches it will be shown.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/job_edit_filter_menu.png"><img alt="job_edit_filter_menu" src="../_images/job_edit_filter_menu.png" style="height: 350px;" /></a> <a class="reference internal" href="../_images/job_edit_filter.png"><img alt="job_edit_filter" src="../_images/job_edit_filter.png" style="height: 350px;" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking the add filter button generates a new filter. The filter requires a column to be selected, an operation to perform, and a value to use in the operation.
Filters can also be removed by clicking the minus button to the right of each filter. After all filters are are entered, press OK to apply the filter to the current panel.</p>
<p>A filter can be cloned and opened in a new tab within the panel through the Clone Filter option in the panel drop down menu. The Clear Filter option can be used to clear all filters from the current panel.</p>
<p>Finally, you can pin the current filters so that they can be restored at a later time using the Pinned Filters sub menu in the panel drop down menu. Note that the Pin Current Filter option is only available if a
filter is currently being applied. If there are no filters, the Pin Current Filter option will be hidden.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-sorting-and-filtering">
<h3>Automatic Sorting and Filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-sorting-and-filtering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Almost every panel has an option to do automatic sorting and filtering when data changes in the panel. When this option is disabled, sorting and filters must
manually be re-applied to ensure that the data is sorted and filtered properly.</p>
<p>Note that automatic sorting and filtering can affect the Monitor’s performance if there are lots of jobs (10,000+) or lots of Workers (1000+) in the farm.
To improve Monitor performance in this case, it is recommended to disable automatic sorting and filtering. There is an option in the Monitor Settings in the <a class="reference internal" href="repository-config.html#repository-config-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Repository Configuration</span></a> to automatically disable it by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-and-loading-panel-layouts">
<h3>Saving and Loading Panel Layouts<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-and-loading-panel-layouts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every list-based panel (Jobs, Workers, Tasks, etc) has an option to save and load the list layout, which you can find in the panel’s drop down menu.
This allows you to save out a list’s filters, column order and visibility, etc, and load them again later or share them with another user.</p>
<p>Note that when loading a list layout, you must choose a layout that was saved from the same type of list. For example, you cannot save a layout from the Job list and then load it into the Worker list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graph-views">
<h3>Graph Views<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-views" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Almost every panel supports showing a graphical representation of the data. The graph can be shown by selecting the Graph View option in the panel’s drop down menu, which can be found in the upper-left corner of the panel. The graph view can be saved as an image file by right-clicking anywhere in view and selecting Save Graph As Image.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/save_task_graph.png"><img alt="../_images/save_task_graph.png" src="../_images/save_task_graph.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_graph_example.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_graph_example.png" src="../_images/monitor_graph_example.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<p>If the graph is a line graph, the following operations are available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Zoom In</strong>: Use the mouse wheel or the UP arrow key to zoom in. You can also click and hold the left mouse button and drag to select a sub-area of the graph to zoom in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zoom Out</strong>: Use the mouse wheel or the DOWN arrow key to zoom out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reset Zoom</strong>: Use the right-click menu to reset the zoom level.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pan</strong>: Use the middle mouse button or the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to pan the graph.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show/Hide Series</strong>: If the line graph has a legend, you can use the right-click menu to customize which series are shown or hidden.</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_graph_zoom.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_graph_zoom.png" src="../_images/monitor_graph_zoom.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<p>If the graph is a pie chart, you can filter the data from the graph view by holding down the SHIFT key and clicking on one of the pie slices. The data will be filtered to only show records that are represented by the pie slice that was clicked on.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/graph_shift_filter.png"><img alt="../_images/graph_shift_filter.png" src="../_images/graph_shift_filter.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scripts">
<h3>Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Almost every panel has the option to run custom scripts from the panel’s right-click menu. Many scripts are already shipped with Deadline, and additional custom scripts can be written. See the <a class="reference internal" href="monitor-scripts.html#monitor-scripts-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Monitor Scripts</span></a>
documentation for more information.</p>
<p>These script menus can also be customized from the <a class="reference internal" href="script-menus.html#configure-script-menus-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Repository Options</span></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-panels">
<span id="info-panels-ref-label"></span><h2>Information Panels<a class="headerlink" href="#information-panels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, information in the Monitor is broken up into different panels. These panels can be created from the View menu, or from the main toolbar.
They can be re-sized, docked, or floated as desired. This allows for a highly customized viewing experience which is adaptable to the needs of different users.</p>
<div class="section" id="jobs">
<h3>Jobs<a class="headerlink" href="#jobs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Jobs panel contains a list that shows all jobs in the farm. It also displays useful information about each job such as it’s name, user, status, error count, plugin, etc.
As jobs change states, their colors will change. Active jobs will appear as green, and will remain green as they continue to render without errors. But if it starts to accumulate errors,
it will turn brown and then eventually red. This allows you to see at a glance which jobs are having problems. For more information on job monitoring, see the <a class="reference internal" href="job-monitoring.html#job-monitoring-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Monitoring Jobs</span></a> documentation.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_job_panel.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_job_panel.png" src="../_images/monitor_job_panel.png" style="height: 450px;" /></a>
<p>The Jobs panel supports standard filtering, but it also has a Quick Filter option in the panel’s drop down menu to make it easier to filter out unwanted jobs. By toggling the options within the Status, User, Pool, Group, and Plugin sections, you can quickly drill down to the jobs you are interested in. There is also an Ego-Centric Sorting optino in the panel’s drop down menu which can be used to keep all of your jobs at the top of the job list.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/filtering.png"><img alt="../_images/filtering.png" src="../_images/filtering.png" style="height: 450px;" /></a>
<p>The Jobs panel also supports the ability to group jobs together based on their Batch Name property. All of the job submitters that are included with Deadline will automatically set the Batch Name if they are submitting multiple jobs that are related to each other. The Batch Name for a job can be modified in the <a class="reference internal" href="job-controlling.html#job-properties-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Job Properties</span></a>. If you prefer to not have the jobs grouped together in the job list, you can disable the Group Jobs By Batch Name option in the <a class="reference internal" href="user-settings.html#user-settings-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Monitor and User Settings</span></a>.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/job_batch_example.png"><img alt="../_images/job_batch_example.png" src="../_images/job_batch_example.png" style="height: 350px;" /></a>
<p>Finally, the Jobs panel allows jobs to be controlled and modified using the right-click menu. You can also bring up the Job Properties window by double clicking on a job. See the <a class="reference internal" href="job-controlling.html#job-controlling-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Controlling Jobs</span></a> documentation for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tasks">
<h3>Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#tasks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Task panel shows all the tasks for the job that is currently selected. It displays useful information about each task such as its frame list, status, and if applicable, the Worker that is rendering it.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_task_panel.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_task_panel.png" src="../_images/monitor_task_panel.png" style="height: 450px;" /></a>
<p>The Task panel also allows you to control tasks from the right-click menu. See the <a class="reference internal" href="job-controlling.html#job-controlling-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Controlling Jobs</span></a> documentation for more information. In addition, the double-click behavior in the Task panel can be set in
the <a class="reference internal" href="user-settings.html#user-settings-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Monitor and User Settings</span></a>, which can be accessed from the main toolbar.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/monitor_worker_panel.png"><img alt="../_images/monitor_worker_panel.png" src="../_images/monitor_worker_panel.png" style="height: 250px;" /></a>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Starting with Deadline 10.1.23, Deadline and its components do not require a license. For older versions, if you see a Worker that is colored orange in the list, this means that the Worker is unable to get a license or that the license is about to expire. When the Worker cannot get a license, it could be because there is a network issue, the license has expired, or the license limit has been reached.</p>
</div>
<p>If a Worker isn’t rendering a job that you think it should be, you can use the <a class="reference internal" href="job-controlling.html#job-render-candidates-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Job Render Candidates</span></a> feature in the Jobs panel to try and figure out why.</p>
