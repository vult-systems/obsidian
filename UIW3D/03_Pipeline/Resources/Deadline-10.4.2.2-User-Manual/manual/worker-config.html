<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Workers panel allows Workers to be controlled and modified using the right-click menu. Note that the availability of these options can vary depending on the context in which they are used, as well as the
filters that are defined for the current user.</p>
<p>If the Workers panel is not visible, see the <a class="reference internal" href="monitor.html#monitor-panel-features-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Panel Features</span></a> documentation for instructions on how to create new panels in the Monitor.</p>

<div class="section" id="worker-states">
<span id="worker-config-states-ref-label"></span><h2>Worker States<a class="headerlink" href="#worker-states" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are the states that a Worker can be in. They are color coded to make it clear which state the Worker is in.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Offline (gray)</strong>: The Worker application is closed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Idle (white)</strong>: The Worker application is running, but it is not currently rendering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rendering (green)</strong>: The Worker application is running, and is rendering a job.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stalled (red)</strong>: A Worker becomes stalled if it hasn’t updated its state for a certain amount of time. This could be because the machine crashed, or the Worker simply didn’t shutdown cleanly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disabled (yellow)</strong>: The Worker has been disabled by an administrator. This prevents the Worker application from launching on the machine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>License Problems (orange)</strong> (DEPRECATED): Starting with Deadline 10.1.23, Deadline and its components do not require a license. For older versions, this means the Worker cannot acquire a license, or its temporary license is about to expire. You can check the License column in the Worker list to see what the problem is.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you see a red Worker, it means the Worker has been marked as stalled. This happens if the Worker hasn’t updated its state for a certain amount of time. You can configure this amount of time in the Wait Times section of the
Worker Settings in the <a class="reference internal" href="repository-config.html#repository-config-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Repository Configuration</span></a>. When a Worker is marked as stalled, it usually means that the machine crashed, or that the Worker simply didn’t shutdown cleanly. In the latter case, you can simply mark the Worker
as offline from the right-click menu.</p>
<p>The Worker panel’s right-click menu also gives the option to delete or disable Workers. When disabled, the Worker application will not be allowed to launch on the machine. This is useful if you are doing maintenance on a machine
and you don’t want the Worker accidentally starting up on it.</p>

<div class="section" id="job-candidate-filter">
<span id="worker-job-candidate-ref-label"></span><h2>Job Candidate Filter<a class="headerlink" href="#job-candidate-filter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Job Candidate Filter in the Workers panel can affect the performance of the Deadline Monitor if there are lots of Workers in the farm. We recommend using the new <a class="reference internal" href="job-controlling.html#job-render-candidates-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Job Render Candidates</span></a> feature in the Jobs panel instead.</p>
</div>
<p>If a Worker isn’t rendering a job that you think it should be, you can use the Job Candidate Filter option in the Worker Panel’s drop down menu to try and figure out why. When the option is enabled, simply click on a job in the Job Panel and the Worker Panel will be filtered to only show the Workers that can render the selected job based on the job’s settings. The filtering takes the following into account:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The job’s pool and group (see the <a class="reference internal" href="pools-and-groups.html#pools-and-groups-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Pools and Groups</span></a> documentation for more information).</p></li>
<li><p>The job’s allow list or deny list, and the allow list or deny list in the job’s assigned limits (see the <a class="reference internal" href="limits.html#limits-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Limits and Machine Limits</span></a> documentation for more information).</p></li>
<li><p>If the Worker has been marked bad for the job (see the <a class="reference internal" href="failure-detection.html#failure-detection-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Job Failure Detection</span></a> documentation for more information).</p></li>

<div class="section" id="worker-settings">
<span id="worker-config-settings-ref-label"></span><h2>Worker Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#worker-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most of the Worker settings be configured from the Monitor while in Power User Mode (or with the proper user privileges) by right-clicking on one or more of them and selecting ‘Modify Worker Properties’. To configure Pools and Groups, you can use the Tools menu, or you can use the Worker panel’s right-click menu. See the <a class="reference internal" href="pools-and-groups.html#pools-and-groups-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Pools and Groups</span></a> documentation for more information.</p>

<p>Note that the only settings here that have an actual impact on rendering are the Concurrent Tasks and CPU Affinity settings. Furthermore, the CPU Affinity feature is only supported on Windows and Linux operating
systems, since macOS does not support process affinity.</p>
<div class="section" id="general">
<span id="worker-config-general-ref-label"></span><h3>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These are some general Worker settings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Worker Description</strong>: A description of the selected Worker. This can be used to provide some pertinent information about the Worker, such as certain system information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Worker Comment</strong>: A short comment regarding the Worker. This can be used to inform other users why certain changes were made to that Worker’s settings, or of any known potential issues with that particular Worker.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normalized Render Time Multiplier</strong>: This value is used to calculate the normalized render time of Tasks. For example, a Worker that normally takes twice as long to render a Task should be assigned a multiplier of 2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normalized Task Timeout Multiplier</strong>: This value is used to calculate the normalized render time of Task Timeouts. Typically, this should be the same value as above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Concurrent Task Limit Override</strong>: The concurrent Task Limit for the Worker. If 0, the Worker’s CPU count is used as the limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Override Remote Command Port</strong>: If enabled, this port will be used by the Worker for remote commands instead of a random port.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Name/IP Address Override</strong>: Overrides the Host name/IP address for remote commands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MAC Address Override</strong>: This is used to override the MAC Address associated with this Worker. This is useful in the event that the Worker defaults to a different MAC Address than the one needed for Wake On Lan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use ‘/tmp’ for Worker Data (Linux) (deprecated)</strong>: If enabled, Workers will write their job and plugin info in the /tmp folder instead of the user folder (Linux only).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The <em>Use ‘/tmp’ for Worker Data (Linux)</em> option will be ignored by workers upgraded to 10.1.11 and above.

<span id="idle-detection"></span><h3>Idle Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#worker-config-idle-detection-ref-label" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These settings can be used to override the global Worker Scheduling settings for the Worker (if there are any). It can be used to start the Worker when its machine becomes idle (based on keyboard and mouse activity), and stop the Worker when its machine is in use again. Note that Idle Detection is managed by the Launcher, so it must be running for this feature to work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Start Worker When Machine Idle For</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will be started on the machine if it is idle. A machine is considered idle if there hasn’t been any keyboard, mouse or tablet activity for the specified amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only Start Worker If CPU Usage Less Than</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will only be launched if the machine’s CPU usage is less than the specified value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only Start Worker If Memory Usage Less Than</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will only be launched if the machine’s memory usage is less than the specified value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only Start Worker If Free Memory More Than</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will only be launched if the machine has more free memory than the specified value (in Megabytes).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only Start Worker If These Processes Are Not Running</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will only be launched if the specified processes are not running on the machine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only Start If Launcher Is Not Running As These Users</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will only be launched if the launcher is not running as one of the specified users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop Worker When Machine Is No Longer Idle</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will be stopped when the machine is no longer idle. A machine is considered idle if there hasn’t been any keyboard, mouse or tablet activity for the specified amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only Stop Worker If Started By Idle Detection</strong>: If enabled, the Worker will only be stopped when the machine is no longer idle if that Worker was originally started by Idle Detection. If the Worker was originally started manually, it will not be stopped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allow Worker To Finish Its Current Task When Stopping</strong>: If enabled, the Worker application will not be closed until it finishes its current Task.</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/worker_settings_idle.png"><img alt="../_images/worker_settings_idle.png" src="../_images/worker_settings_idle.png" style="height: 450px;" /></a>
<p>There are some limitations with Idle Detection depending on the operating system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On Windows, Idle Detection will NOT work if the Launcher is running as a service. This is because the service runs in an environment that is separate from the Desktop, and has no knowledge of any mouse or keyboard activity.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux, the Launcher uses <a class="reference internal" href="install-client.html#linux-install-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">X11</span></a> to determine if there has been any mouse or keyboard activity. If <a class="reference internal" href="install-client.html#linux-install-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">X11</span></a> is not available, Idle Detection will NOT work. One such situation is when the launcher is run as a daemon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Idle Detection can be overridden in the <a class="reference internal" href="local-worker.html#local-worker-ref-label"><span class="std std-ref">Local Worker Controls</span></a> so that users can configure if their local Worker should launch when the machine becomes idle.</p>

<p>Note that Deadline currently cannot detect the number of GPUs a system has. Instead, it just assumes that there are no more than 16 GPUs. Make sure to configure the GPU affinity settings based on the number of GPUs the machine actually has.</p>

<p>Note that unlike CPU affinity, GPU affinity isn’t automatically applied to all renders. It is up to the individual Deadline application plugins to pull this information from the Worker’s at render time and pass them to the renderer.</p>

<h3>Tagging Workers on Start Up<a class="headerlink" href="#tagging-workers-on-start-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As an alternative to having the Deadline Worker software add the tag on start up you can apply the tag before launching the Deadline Worker Software.</p>
<p>Do the following to add the version tag to your Worker EC2 instances:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Either create or modify the launch template that you will be using. See <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html</a>, for more information on launch templates.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Resource</span> <span class="pre">tags</span></code> section.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Add</span> <span class="pre">tag</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Key</span></code> input <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeadlineAWSResource</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Value</span></code> input <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v&lt;version&gt;</span></code> where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;version&gt;</span></code> is the version of the Deadline Worker that will run on the EC2 instance.</p></li>
