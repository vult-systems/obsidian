# Obsidian Repository
This repo contains my shared and public Obsidian notes. It serves as a version controlled note-taking environment for evaluating and refining:
- directory structures
- workflow practices
- collaboration
- note-taking and documentation standards
- technical writing
- and more

The goal is to develop and validate best practices that can be applied to larger knowledge bases and production processes for my personal and professional work.
